Hey! I'm typewatch, a guy on the internet that likes to learn about interesting stuff. I am a writer, linux nerd and an engineering hobbyist.

Welcome to my little corner of the internet! I made this website as a companion for my bigger projects; this'll be where I store and organize writeups, details, resources, docs, guides, and whatnot. I might post a blog entry or two every now and then, but for now, I'll be passing some stuff over from a couple of repos. 

Stay tuned for more to come!
