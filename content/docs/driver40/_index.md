Driver40 is an ultraportable, 4x5 ortholinear, low profile split keyboard. Handful of words huh? Here's what they mean:

- **4x5:** The keyboard is built with a 4-row, 5-column key configuration.
- **ortholinear:** This means that the keys in the keyboard are *not staggered,* and instead aligned in a square grid.
- **low profile:** As you might've guessed, this means that the keyboard's height is low, or in other words, it is a particularly slim keyboard.
- **split:** In contrast to a typical keyboard, which is one long rectangular slab with keys, a *split* keyboard is two slabs, interconnected with wires or through wireless signals.

## Why?

I like split keyboards, and needed a portable keyboard to carry with me on a day-to-day basis. I have an MX lily58 at home, and I really like it, but sometimes when I'm away from my desk and I need to sit down and churn out some code, do homework, or just play a game, I miss the perfection that is 

I looked around for a little while, and found nothing that caught my eye, so I decided to make my own. After all, I have previously done similar things, and I figured it'd be worth it since I would be able to fine-tune it to my liking.

I set forth a few things I wanted out of a keyboard, and got sketching. You can see the whole process in the more in-depth write-up found at driver40/devlog/, or at my website.

Driver40 is what I ended up with. I also implemented a few other nifty features and turned them into their own variations of the primary build, which you can see above.
