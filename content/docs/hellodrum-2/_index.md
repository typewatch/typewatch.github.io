HelloDrum-2 is an unofficial remix and continuation of the original HelloDrum DIY e-drums project by Ryo Kosaka.

HelloDrum is a simple, **open source**, easy-to-build modular e-drum kit made to be as cheap and easy to build as possible that utilizes the MIDI protocol, making it compatible with virtually every music-making hardware or software out there. You can mix-n-match modules to create your own kit, or pick your favorite ones to expand your current e-kit!
